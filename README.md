## Skill Sample Java Pager Karaoke

One of the most important motivators for using Alexa Presentation Language (APL) is the ability to distinguish between devices.

This skill demonstrates 3 features of APL: the [Pager Component](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-presentation-language/apl-pager.html), [SpeakItem Command](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-presentation-language/apl-commands-components.html), and accessing [device characteristics](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-presentation-language/apl-viewport-characteristics.html) in the skill code.

In this skill, a user asks Alexa “Show me pager”, and they will see a template that demonstrates the [Pager Component](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-presentation-language/apl-pager.html) using the AutoPage command.

A user can also ask Alexa, "Show me karaoke". The skill will demonstrate using the [SpeakItem Command](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-presentation-language/apl-commands-components.html) which mimicks a karaoke-like functionality to a [Text Component](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-presentation-language/apl-text.html).

Finally, a user can ask Alexa, "Show me devices". Vocally, if requested on an Echo Spot, Alexa would respond “I am on small round hub!” on the device (when appropriate), it shows what the device is called.
